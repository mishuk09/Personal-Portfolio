The efficient and sustainable use of fertilizers in agriculture has long been a critical challenge in enhancing food security while minimizing environmental impacts. Among various fertilizer types, urea has emerged as one of the most widely used nitrogen fertilizers. However, excessive urea application often results in ammonia emissions and nitrate leaching, contributing significantly to soil degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, studies have shown that ammonia volatilization from urea accounts for significant nitrogen loss and environmental pollution, making it an important area of focus for agricultural research [Paper 19, Paper 25
]. Additionally, strategies such as coated fertilizers and controlled-release mechanisms have been explored to optimize fertilizer use and minimize nitrogen losses [Paper 4, Paper 24

The optimization of ammonia emissions from urea fertilizer production represents a critical challenge in sustainable agricultural manufacturing, with different methodological approaches offering varying degrees of effectiveness in addressing environmental and operational concerns. The efficient and sustainable use of fertilizers in agriculture has long been essential for enhancing food security while minimizing environmental impacts. Among various fertilizer types, urea has emerged as one of the most widely used nitrogen fertilizers globally. However, excessive urea application often results in ammonia emissions and nitrate leaching, contributing significantly to soil degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The scale of this problem is substantial, with global ammonia emissions from urea fertilizers estimated to account for approximately 10 to 12 Tg N/year, representing around 23% of global ammonia emissions. Studies have demonstrated that ammonia volatilization from urea accounts for significant nitrogen loss and environmental pollution, making it a critical area of focus for agricultural research [

This comparative review focuses on two studies: the Proportional Impact Prediction Model of Coating Material on Nitrate Leaching of Slow-Release Urea Super Granules USG by Swain et al. 2024 [Paper A
], and the Improving Ammonia Emission Model of Urea Fertilizer Fluidized Bed Granulation System using Particle Swarm Optimization for Sustainable Fertilizer Manufacturing Practice by Norhidayah Mohamad et al. [Paper B
]. These papers tackle critical environmental concerns related to urea-based fertilizers, but each presents a different approach. While Swain et al. 2024[Paper A
] focus on predicting and minimizing nitrate leaching using machine learning models and Response Surface Methodology RSM [Paper A
], Mohamad et al. aim to optimize ammonia emissions during urea fertilizer production using Particle Swarm Optimization PSO [Paper B
].

The rationale for comparing these two papers stems from their innovative methodologies in addressing the same overarching problem—reducing nitrogen losses from urea fertilizers yet they employ distinct strategies. [Paper A
] introduces advanced machine learning algorithms and experimental designs for optimizing nitrate leaching, making it a noteworthy contribution to precision agriculture [Paper 1, Paper 12
]. On the other hand,
[Paper B
] utilizes PSO for model optimization in the context of fertilizer production processes, contributing to sustainable manufacturing practices in the urea industry [Paper 10, Paper 17
].

In this review, we will compare the methodological approaches used by both studies. Specifically, we will examine their research designs, data collection methods, and analytical techniques. While Swain et al. [Paper A
] emphasize experimental optimization with a focus on nitrate leaching in agricultural soil, Mohamad et al. [Paper B
] concentrate on computational modeling to reduce emissions in the industrial production process. This review will highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering a comprehensive understanding of how different methodologies can be leveraged to achieve sustainable fertilizer use and reduced environmental impact.





// final introduction 


Optimizing ammonia emissions from urea fertilizer production is a significant challenge for creating more sustainable agricultural practices. Various methods have been developed to address the environmental and operational concerns that come with fertilizer use, each with varying levels of success. Fertilizers, particularly urea, have been essential for improving food security by increasing crop yields. However, they also have considerable environmental downsides. Urea is one of the most widely used nitrogen fertilizers around the world, but when applied excessively, it can lead to ammonia emissions and nitrate leaching. These problems contribute to soil degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, it’s estimated that global ammonia emissions from urea fertilizers account for roughly 10 to 12 Tg of nitrogen per year, making up about 23% of all ammonia emissions. Studies have shown that ammonia volatilization from urea results in substantial nitrogen loss, which harms both the environment and the efficiency of fertilizer use, making it a critical area of focus for agricultural research [
   19,
   25
]. To tackle these issues, researchers have explored different strategies, such as coated fertilizers and controlled-release mechanisms, to optimize fertilizer use and reduce nitrogen losses [
   4,
   24
].

This review examines two studies that approach the problem from different angles. The first is the work by Swain et al. [
   2024
], titled Proportional Impact Prediction Model of Coating Material on Nitrate Leaching of Slow-Release Urea Super Granules [USG
] [Paper A
], and the second is by Norhidayah Mohamad et al., titled Improving Ammonia Emission Model of Urea Fertilizer Fluidized Bed Granulation System using Particle Swarm Optimization for Sustainable Fertilizer Manufacturing Practice [Paper B
]. Both studies address the environmental issues linked to urea-based fertilizers, but each takes a unique approach. Swain et al. [Paper A
] focus on predicting and minimizing nitrate leaching through machine learning models and Response Surface Methodology [RSM
], whereas Mohamad et al. [Paper B
] aim to optimize ammonia emissions during urea production using Particle Swarm Optimization [PSO
].

The reason for comparing these two studies is that, while both aim to reduce nitrogen losses from urea fertilizers, they do so through very different methodologies. [Paper A
] brings in advanced machine learning algorithms and experimental designs to optimize nitrate leaching, which offers an important contribution to the growing field of precision agriculture [
   1,
   12
]. On the other hand,
[Paper B
] utilizes PSO to fine-tune models in the context of fertilizer production processes, contributing to more sustainable practices in the urea manufacturing industry [
   10,
   17
].

In this review, we’ll look at how these two studies approach their research. We’ll explore their research designs, data collection methods, and the techniques they use for analysis. Swain et al. [Paper A
] emphasize experimental optimization to reduce nitrate leaching in agricultural soils, while Mohamad et al. [Paper B
] concentrate on computational modeling to cut ammonia emissions during urea fertilizer production. By comparing these different approaches, this review aims to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each, helping us understand how these methodologies can lead to more sustainable fertilizer use and reduced environmental impact.

### 2. Related Work--------2

A significant body of research has explored methods to optimize nitrogen use in agriculture, focusing on minimizing nitrate leaching and ammonia emissions. Various techniques, including machine learning, response surface methodology [RSM
], and optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization [PSO
], have been applied to tackle these issues. Understanding these methodologies in existing research is crucial to positioning [Paper A
] and [Paper B
] within the broader landscape of fertilizer optimization studies.

#### Review of Methodologies

Several studies have employed machine learning algorithms to predict and optimize nitrogen loss from fertilizers. For instance, Duffuaa [Paper 1
] developed a mathematical optimization model for ammonia and urea production at SAFCO, which incorporated PSO to minimize production costs while meeting required targets. This study shares similarities with [Paper A
], as both use optimization techniques to enhance fertilizer efficiency. Furthermore, Sreenivasa Rao et al. [Paper 49
] utilized linear programming and Monte Carlo simulations for optimizing ammonia emissions from rice paddies, showcasing an approach that contrasts with [Paper A
] machine learning methods, yet both aim to reduce nitrogen losses. Additionally, Alfi and Modares [Paper 5
] presented an adaptive PSO model to improve system identification and PID control, which aligns more with Paper B's use of PSO for optimization in fertilizer production.

In terms of experimental approaches, Zhang et al. [Paper 4
] studied the long-term impacts of coated urea fertilizers on soil properties and microbial communities, which directly relates to Paper A's focus on coating materials for slow-release fertilizers. Their methodology, which combined regression analysis and optimization techniques, echoes the experimental setup of Swain et al. [
   2024
] in [Paper A
], though Swain et al. implement more advanced machine learning models like Artificial Neural Networks [ANN
] and Support Vector Machines [SVM
] for nitrate leaching prediction.

#### Contrast with [Paper A
] and [Paper B
]

While both Paper A and [Paper B
] focus on optimizing fertilizer application, they differ significantly in their methodologies. Swain et al. [
   2024
] take a data-driven approach, utilizing multiple machine learning models (including ANN, SVM, and Random Forest (RF) to predict nitrate leaching and evaluate the effectiveness of coated Urea Super Granules [USG
]. This approach contrasts with Mohamad et al. in Paper B, who applied PSO to optimize ammonia emissions during the urea granulation process, where the focus is more on the manufacturing process rather than field application. Additionally, Guangqing Li et al. [Paper 6
], while not using machine learning, employed review synthesis and controlled-release fertilizers to study their impact on crop yield, which aligns with Paper A's objective of optimizing fertilizer release to minimize environmental impact.

Moreover, studies like Norhidayah et al. [Paper 10
] focused on RSM for optimizing biodegradable urea production and reducing ammonia emissions, which resonates with Paper B's focus on fluidized bed granulation systems for urea manufacturing. However, Paper B's PSO-based optimization model for granulation stands out due to its emphasis on computational efficiency and precision.

#### Purpose of Comparison

The methodologies presented in Paper A and Paper B offer complementary insights into the issue of nitrogen loss from fertilizers. The machine learning-based approach in Paper A offers a predictive and optimization framework for nitrate leaching in agricultural systems, while Paper B presents a more industrially focused approach, optimizing ammonia emissions during fertilizer production through PSO. By comparing these methodologies, we can understand how different strategies—data-driven techniques versus computational optimization—can be employed to address similar environmental issues. Furthermore, examining the contrasting applications of these methods will shed light on the advantages and limitations of each approach, thereby enriching the broader discourse on sustainable fertilizer practices.

#### Overview of Methodologies

The methodologies employed in the two studies are summarized below:

1. Paper A (Swain et al.,
2024):

   * Research Design: Experimental and Computational Approach. The study combines laboratory experiments with computational models to predict nitrate leaching from USG coated with various materials.
   * Data Collection:

     * Three types of coatings (bentonite clay, neem oil, sulfur, acacia oil) were applied to USG.
     * Soil columns were used to simulate field conditions, and leachate was collected at regular intervals.
     * Nitrate leaching was measured using the Cadmium Reduction Method.
   * Analysis:

     * Machine Learning Algorithms: The study utilized several ML models (ANN, SVM, RF, M5P, REPTree) for predicting nitrate leaching and optimizing the coating material.
     * Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed to determine optimal coating parameters.
   * Validation: Model performance was evaluated using various statistical measures like RMSE, MAE, and R.

2. Paper B (Mohamad et al.,
2024):

   * Research Design: Experimental Optimization Approach. This study focuses on optimizing the ammonia emissions from the fluidized bed granulation process of urea fertilizer production.
   * Data Collection:

     * The experimental setup involved varying parameters such as pressure, binder feed rate, and temperature to evaluate their effect on ammonia emissions.
     * Ammonia emissions were measured continuously using ppm sensors during the granulation process.
   * Analysis:

     * The data were modeled using a quadratic polynomial approach.
     * Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was applied to find the optimal model parameters by minimizing the Mean Square Error (MSE).
   * Validation: The optimized model was validated by comparing predictions to experimental data. Performance was evaluated through MSE and surface plots for visual accuracy.

#### Comparative Approach

The comparison of the methodologies in both papers is structured around key areas:

1. Research Design:

   * Paper A employs a combined experimental and computational approach, integrating laboratory simulations and machine learning models to predict nitrate leaching. This approach allows for a detailed understanding of the influence of coating materials on nitrate loss.
   * Paper B, in contrast, focuses on optimizing ammonia emissions through a purely experimental approach coupled with PSO optimization. The study optimizes parameters in the real-world granulation system to control ammonia release.

2. Data Collection:

   * Both studies use experimental data collection, but Paper A uses controlled laboratory setups with soil columns and specific coating types, while Paper B collects real-time data from the fluidized bed granulation process in an industrial context.
   * Paper A collects leachate data to measure nitrate loss, whereas Paper B tracks ammonia emissions using continuous ppm sensors.

3. Analysis Techniques:

   * Paper A relies heavily on machine learning algorithms to model and predict nitrate leaching, whereas Paper B uses the PSO algorithm to optimize the ammonia emission model parameters.
   * Paper A uses RSM to refine and optimize experimental results, whereas Paper B uses quadratic polynomial modeling to fit data and PSO for optimization.
   * Both studies use a validation approach to compare their model predictions against experimental data, but the methods of model evaluation differ significantly (e.g., ML metrics in Paper A versus MSE and surface plots in Paper B).

4. Effectiveness of Approaches:

   * Paper A demonstrates that machine learning models (especially RSM) can significantly improve the accuracy of predictions regarding nitrate leaching, with RSM outperforming all other ML models.
   * Paper B shows that PSO optimization can be effective in modeling and reducing ammonia emissions with high prediction accuracy, supported by a small error margin in ammonia emission predictions.

#### Data Analysis for Comparative Review

The data analysis compares both studies based on their methodology:

* Modeling Techniques: The use of ML models in Paper A allows for a flexible, highly accurate prediction model for nitrate leaching, while Paper B’s use of PSO provides a robust method for optimizing ammonia emission models.
* Validation and Accuracy: Both studies achieve high levels of model accuracy, but Paper A provides more diverse models to predict multiple variables (nitrate leaching with various coatings), while Paper B focuses on a single pollutant (ammonia) within a specific manufacturing process.
* Generalizability: The results in Paper A may be more generalizable to various soil types and coating materials, whereas Paper B is more context-specific to fertilizer manufacturing.

#### Limitations of the Review

* Paper A’s findings are based on laboratory conditions, which may not fully represent real-world agricultural settings. Additionally, the study uses a limited number of coating types and environmental conditions.
* Paper B focuses on a specific industrial process, limiting the generalizability of its findings. The optimization of only three parameters may oversimplify the complexity of ammonia emissions in real-world fertilizer production.
